## Sales Projection Project AWS
In DynamoDB sales related data in continewously getting published our task is to transform it and save it into s3 bucket.

1. Created DynamoDB table with name gadgetOrders and enabled CDC related settings. On other hand we set up kinesis stream and setup eventBridge pipe
2. In eventBridge pipe we setup source as a DynamoDB table and destination as kinesis stream with partiotin key as eventID.
3. whereas in kinesis stream we setup source as a eventBridge.
4. After that we setup a firehose which takes data from kinesis stream and setup destination as s3 bucket.
In firehose we enabled transform source as lambda and add our lambda function related all details to it. 
Basically when firehose start gettting data our lambda function get triggered and perforem some data validation and transformation on it 
this transformation happens for record by record and at the end data is stored in s3 bucket.
5. we create glue crawler which crawl target s3 bucket and created glue database in glue catalog for registering table.
6. At the end it we Run Athena query on top of it and check the results.
